# Disconnected (Air-Gapped) Deployment Guide

Deploy Cost Management On-Premise in disconnected OpenShift environments using `oc-mirror` for chart and image mirroring.

## Overview

In disconnected environments, clusters have no direct internet access. The `oc-mirror` tool mirrors Helm charts and container images from public registries to an internal mirror registry. The cost-onprem chart is designed to support offline templating -- `helm template` works with default values only (no `--set` flags required), which is exactly how `oc-mirror` discovers images.

> **Important:** Some images used by the chart cannot be auto-discovered by
> `oc-mirror` (for example, images referenced only in Helm hooks such as
> `pre-install`/`pre-upgrade`). These **must** be listed explicitly in the
> `additionalImages` section of the `ImageSetConfiguration`. See
> [Required Container Images](#required-container-images) for the full list
> and [Step 1](#step-1-create-imagesetconfiguration) for the complete
> configuration.

## Prerequisites

- **oc-mirror v2** installed ([installation guide](https://docs.okd.io/latest/disconnected/mirroring/about-installing-oc-mirror-v2.html))
- Access to a mirror registry (e.g., `mirror.example.com:5000`)
- A connected workstation with internet access for running `oc-mirror`
- OpenShift CLI (`oc`) configured for the disconnected cluster

## Required Container Images

The table below lists every container image used by the cost-onprem chart.
Images marked **additional** are not auto-discovered by `oc-mirror` and
**must** appear in the `additionalImages` section of the
`ImageSetConfiguration`. Failing to include them will cause pods to enter
`ImagePullBackOff` in the disconnected cluster.

| Image | Component | Discovery |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| `quay.io/insights-onprem/ros-ocp-backend:latest` | ROS API, Processor, Poller, Housekeeper, Migration | auto |
| `quay.io/insights-onprem/koku:sources` | Cost Management API, MASU, Celery, Listener, Migration | auto |
| `quay.io/redhat-services-prod/kruize-autotune-tenant/autotune:d0b4337` | Kruize optimization engine | auto |
| `quay.io/insights-onprem/insights-ingress-go:latest` | Ingress service | auto |
| `quay.io/insights-onprem/postgresql:16` | PostgreSQL database (Helm hook) | **additional** |
| `registry.redhat.io/rhel10/valkey-8:latest` | Valkey cache | auto |
| `registry.redhat.io/openshift-service-mesh/proxyv2-rhel9:2.6` | Envoy gateway | auto |
| `registry.redhat.io/rhceph/oauth2-proxy-rhel9:v7.6.0` | UI OAuth proxy | auto |
| `quay.io/insights-onprem/koku-ui-onprem:latest` | Cost Management UI | auto |
| `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal:latest` | Init containers (wait-for probes) | auto |
| `amazon/aws-cli:latest` | S3 bucket creation (`install-helm-chart.sh`) | **script** |

> **Note:** The `amazon/aws-cli:latest` image is used by `install-helm-chart.sh` for
> one-shot S3 bucket creation (not by the Helm chart itself). Override with
> `S3_CLI_IMAGE` to point to a mirrored copy. If you create buckets manually or
> use `SKIP_S3_SETUP=true`, this image is not required.

> **Why are some images not auto-discovered?** `oc-mirror` discovers images
> by running `helm template` internally. Kubernetes resources created via
> [Helm hooks](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/) (such as the
> database `StatefulSet` with `helm.sh/hook: pre-install,pre-upgrade`) are
> excluded from that rendering, so `oc-mirror` never sees the images they
> reference. CI enforces parity between `helm template` and `oc-mirror`;
> see `.github/workflows/lint-and-validate.yml`.

## Step 1: Create ImageSetConfiguration

Create a file named `imageset-config.yaml`. The `additionalImages` section
is **required** -- it lists images that `oc-mirror` cannot discover from
the Helm chart automatically (see [Required Container Images](#required-container-images)).

```yaml
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
mirror:
  helm:
    repositories:
      - name: cost-onprem
        url: https://insights-onprem.github.io/cost-onprem-chart
        charts:
          - name: cost-onprem
            version: "0.2.10"
  # Images that oc-mirror cannot auto-discover from the Helm chart.
  # These are used in Helm hooks (pre-install/pre-upgrade) which are
  # not rendered during oc-mirror's image discovery pass.
  # Keep in sync with the "Required Container Images" table above.
  additionalImages:
    - name: quay.io/insights-onprem/postgresql:16
    # Only needed if using install-helm-chart.sh for bucket creation:
    - name: amazon/aws-cli:latest
```

## Step 2: Mirror to Disk

On the connected workstation, mirror the chart and images to a local archive:

```bash
oc-mirror --v2 -c imageset-config.yaml file://mirror-output
```

This creates a directory `mirror-output/` containing:
- The packaged Helm chart
- All container images as OCI archives
- A mapping file for the mirror registry

## Step 3: Transfer to Disconnected Environment

Copy the `mirror-output/` directory to the disconnected environment using your preferred transfer method (USB drive, secure file transfer, etc.).

## Step 4: Mirror to Internal Registry

On the disconnected cluster (or a bastion host with access to the mirror registry):

```bash
oc-mirror --v2 -c imageset-config.yaml \
  --from file://mirror-output \
  docker://mirror.example.com:5000
```

## Step 5: Apply ICSP/IDMS

After mirroring, `oc-mirror` generates `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) or `ImageDigestMirrorSet` (IDMS) resources. Apply them to the cluster:

```bash
oc apply -f mirror-output/results-*/
```

This configures the cluster to pull images from the mirror registry instead of the original registries.

## Step 6: Install the Chart

Install the chart from the mirrored registry. Use the install script with the local chart:

```bash
# Option A: Use the mirrored chart directly
helm install cost-onprem oci://mirror.example.com:5000/cost-onprem/cost-onprem \
  --version 0.2.10 \
  --namespace cost-onprem \
  --create-namespace

# Option B: Use the install script with the extracted chart
USE_LOCAL_CHART=true LOCAL_CHART_PATH=./cost-onprem \
  ./scripts/install-helm-chart.sh
```

The ICSP/IDMS applied in Step 5 ensures that all image pulls are redirected to the mirror registry automatically.

## Verification

After installation, verify that all pods are running and images are pulled from the mirror registry:

```bash
# Check all pods are running
kubectl get pods -n cost-onprem -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=cost-onprem

# Verify images come from mirror registry
kubectl get pods -n cost-onprem -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.spec.containers[*].image}{"\n"}{end}' | sort -u
```

## Updating Images

When new versions are released, update the `ImageSetConfiguration` with the new chart version and image tags, then repeat the mirror process (Steps 2-5). The install script supports version pinning:

```bash
CHART_VERSION=0.2.10 ./scripts/install-helm-chart.sh
```

> **Remember:** When image tags change in `values.yaml`, check whether any
> `additionalImages` entries need updating as well. CI will fail if the
> images reported by `helm template` are not fully covered by `oc-mirror`.
