"""
External API tests for cost model endpoints.

These tests validate the cost model API contract by making direct HTTP calls
through the gateway with JWT authentication.

Cost models allow users to:
- Define rates for CPU, memory, storage, and node/cluster costs
- Apply markup/discount percentages
- Assign cost models to sources/integrations

API Endpoint: /api/cost-management/v1/cost-models/

Note: This is a SaaS parity feature - no Jira epic currently exists for on-prem.

Status: VALIDATED (2026-02-13)
- All 6 tests pass against live cluster
- Cost models can be created without source_uuids (empty sources list)
- Endpoint exists at /api/cost-management/v1/cost-models/
- CRUD operations work as expected
